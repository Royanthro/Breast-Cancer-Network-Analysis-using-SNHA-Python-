# Breast-Cancer-Network-Analysis-using-SNHA-Python-
This project applies the St. Nicolas House Algorithm (SNHA) to the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to construct and analyze correlation-based networks. It includes graph visualization with matplotlib and networkx, and identifies central nodes using key centrality measures (degree, betweenness, eigenvector).
